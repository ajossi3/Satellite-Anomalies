# Satellite-Anomalies
This project analyzes and predicts anomalies in satellites based on space weather events. Using historical anomaly data from NOAA and irradiance measurements (X-ray and EUV flux), the goal is to identify patterns, trends, and correlations between space weather and satellite performance disruptions.
